# 🎬 **1) OPENING — THE PROBLEM (Slide 2)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Shreyanshu**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Imagine this. You’re a venture capitalist with a ₹600 crore fund.
> Your inbox is flooded with pitch decks — easily more than a thousand in a year.
> And somewhere in that pile might be the next **Swiggy**… the next **Paytm**… the next Indian unicorn.”
>
> “But here’s the truth investors don’t say out loud: analysing one pitch deck properly takes **4 to 6 hours**.
> So out of a thousand startups, only **1 %** ever get a deep, structured evaluation. The remaining 99% are dismissed — not because they’re bad, but because there simply isn’t enough time.”
>
> “This leads to missed opportunities, inconsistent evaluations, subjective judgments, and sometimes even burnout in analyst teams.”
>
> “This bottleneck is not just inconvenient. It directly affects deal-flow, investment quality, and the future of innovation.”

⏱ **Duration:** 40 seconds

# 🚀 **2) OUR SOLUTION (Slide 3)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Ashwin**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Now imagine a world where analysing a startup doesn’t take six hours.
> It doesn’t take one hour.
> It takes just **2 minutes**.”
>
> “This is what we built — **Startup Analyst-XI**, an AI-powered platform that converts pitch decks and business plans into complete investor-ready briefs.
> You simply upload a PDF or DOCX, and in minutes, you receive a complete analysis — including market insights, team assessment, risk profiling, frameworks, ratings, and strategic recommendations.”
>
> “And this is not a prototype. It is fully deployed, live on the internet, and available to use right now.”

# 📱 **3) QR CODE + LIVE DEPLOYMENT (Slide 4)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Ashwin**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Before I start the demo, here is a QR code. Anyone in the room can scan this and try the product yourselves.
> The entire platform is deployed on **Vercel**, fully responsive, and works equally well on mobile and desktop.”

⏱ **Duration:** 10 seconds

# 🖥 **4) DEMO — PART 1 (Upload + Authentication)**

### 📍 **DEMO SECTION: Website Home Page**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Ashwin**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Let me show you how simple the workflow is.
> First, I’ll sign in using **Google Auth**. We use Google OAuth because it lets us rate-limit Gemini usage per user, keep analysis history, and prepare for future billing.”
>
> “Once logged in, this is our homepage.
> We have a drag-and-drop upload area, a company name field, and the option to process documents up to 25 MB.”
>
> “For the demo, I’ll upload the prospectus of **PhysicsWallah**, a well-known ed-tech company that recently went public.
> This is a real, heavy, multi-page business document — and our system will analyse it from scratch.”
>
> “Now I’ll hit ‘Generate’. The processing will take around 80 to 90 seconds, so while the AI works in the background, we’ll return to the slides.”

⏱ **Duration:** 20 seconds

# ⚙️ **5) TECHNOLOGIES USED (Slide 5)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Ashwin**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Here’s what powers the analysis behind the scenes.”
>
> “We use **Gemini 2.5 Pro** through Vertex AI for deep document understanding — extracting financials, team details, risks, traction, market data, and product information directly from the uploaded PDFs or DOCX files.”
>
> “Then we use **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** to perform live web searches, gather the latest market intelligence, competitive landscape, and any missing context that the document alone cannot provide.”
>
> “For authentication and user identity, we rely on **Google OAuth 2.0**, and everything integrates seamlessly using **Google Vertex AI** APIs.”
>
> “This combination of document intelligence + real-time web intelligence is what makes the platform far superior to traditional AI summarizers.”

# 🧠 **6) FEATURES + FRAMEWORKS (Slide 6)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Shreyanshu**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Now let’s talk about what makes this analysis meaningful for investors.”
>
> “Startup Analyst-XI goes far beyond text summaries.
> It generates investor-grade outputs using real strategic frameworks:
>
> - It builds a full **Business Model Canvas** for the startup.
> - It applies the **Ansoff Matrix** to evaluate product and market positioning.
> - It uses the **Rogers Bell Curve** to determine adoption maturity.
> - It assigns **multi-dimensional ratings** from 0 to 100 across team strength, market quality, traction, moat, and risks.
> - It performs structured **problem and solution analysis**, **market evaluation**, and **risk scoring**.
> - And it includes an interactive **AI chatbot** that answers detailed questions using both the document and real-time web data.”
>
> “All of this is generated automatically — in minutes — and packaged into a clean, ready-to-use investor brief.”

>
> “In a few seconds, the chatbot responds using the PDF and the web — giving the exact profit and the source context.”
>
> “This blends document intelligence with fresh online information, which is something static summarizers cannot do.”

### 👤 **SCRIPT (Akshay):**

> “At the very bottom of every analysis you can see if there were any past analysis done for this same business. On the left, we also have a **History** section that stores every analysis a user has ever done.”
> “And here is the **Go Pro** section — a simple form that users can fill if they want to increase their limit beyond the current 25 free analyses per account. In future we would integrate payment gateway so that users can themsleves upgrade their plans.”

# 🆚 **10) COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION (Slide 9)**

### 👤 **Speaker:** **Shreyanshu**

### 🎤 **SCRIPT:**

> “Most AI tools today generate plain summaries or a single score.
> They don’t provide frameworks, ratings, risk assessment, or multi-layered insights.”
>
> “Startup Analyst-XI is purpose-built for investors.
> It uses strategic models, structured outputs, multi-dimensional ratings, and source attribution.”
>
> “And the biggest differentiator is that we are **fully live** — not a prototype, not a localhost demo — but a functioning product already being used.”
